## Requirements

You must have vapor toolbox installed to use this template, at least it helps.

### For macOS

[Vapor docs](https://docs.vapor.codes/3.0/install/macos/)

Assuming you have Xcode installed, or swift setted up on your machine, run:

```
brew tap vapor/tap
brew install vapor/tap/vapor
```

### For Ubuntu

[Vapor docs](https://docs.vapor.codes/3.0/install/ubuntu/)

Assuming you have swift installed and configured on your machine, follow the following steps to install vapor

Add APT repo

`eval "$(curl -sL https://apt.vapor.sh)"`

Install vapor

`sudo apt-get install swift vapor`

## Using this template

Vapor toolbox allows to start a new project by cloning a template

`vapor new <service name> --template=youclap/vapor-template`

To open the project in xcode, you have to generate a project

`vapor xcode` which is the same as `swift package generate-xcodeproj`

Configuring the repository to use versioned hooks

`git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig`

* **pre-commit** hook - Runs swiftlint in all the project files

### The Structure

üöß Insert an image with architecture here üöß

#### Controllers

The controllers should be specific to the kind of communication we want to support, for example if it is **HTTP** we should have a `HTTPController`, if it is RPC we should have a `RPCController` and so on...

The controller should be responsible to configure the routes, deal with packages, requests, responses, status codes, errors and other things related with the protocol.
Everything else that isn't related with the protocol, should be handled in the specific layer.

The controller should conform with the protocol `RouterController` and implement the method `func boot(router: Router) throws` where all the routes are configured.

It should have his own set of errors, it should never expose the other layers errors through the response.
It should conform with the protocol `Debuggable` and implement the properties `identifier` and `reason`.

On going... üöß
